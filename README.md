Hey there! I’m Nat (she/her),

Prior to making this Github account I was actually a middle school Math teacher! I adored being a teacher but missed being in the coding field, so I am now currently enrolled at UNCG taking Computer Science and searching for a Summer 2022 Internship!  

Tell me more-more about yourself:
- 🔭 I'm a curious being whose always ready to take on new tasks
- 🌱 There's always room for growth! Currently I'm growing in Big-O analysis.
- 👯 I'm looking for a team oriented work space who enjoys collaboration and  problem solving 
- 😁 I enjoy making people smile and laugh, if you’re having a bad day, come see me! 

Coding experience?
- 💻 My first learned language was Python! (both self taught(thanks Udemy!) and through college courses).
 🏫 Second language- I’m currently fresh on Java. I think many CS degrees focus on java right? So far I enjoy it, but python just has this beauty to it y'know? (shh don’t tell java). * Please see my code below *

Here’s some topics I have learned already.
- 🗯 I only know how to System.out.print, hire me! (joking) 
- 🪀 Strings/Lists/Arrays/Tuples
- ➿ Loops (for,while,do-while,nested)
- 🕗 Manipulations (except those tuples!)
- 🚗 OOP 
- 📚 Methods

Anything else we should know?
- Of course, I also love to dabble in graphic design! I co-created my fiance's website for both desktop and mobile users. Prior to making it, we sat down and went through a variety of “likes and dislikes”. I made a checklist(best way to remember things), pros and cons of different templates, and how exactly I would be able to reach the target audience (also set up a google page for those needed reviews!)

Man you’re awesome, how can we chat? 
- 💬 Please don’t be shy, ask me anything! 📫 Best way to reach me is by email! (contact on resume)
